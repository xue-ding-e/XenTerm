## What is XenTerm

XenTerm is a native desktop terminal client that keeps the workflow people like about
FinalShell — a resource-monitor sidebar, session management, tabbed terminals, an SFTP
panel that follows your shell — while dropping the part they do not: several hundred
megabytes of JVM. It is a single Rust binary with the interface built directly on
[GPUI](https://gpui.rs), so there is no interpreter, no web runtime and no garbage
collector in the process.

It is a client, not a re-implementation of a shell: SSH, Telnet and serial sessions talk
to whatever runs on the other end, and local shells run in a real PTY / ConPTY.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Sessions** | SSH, local shell (PowerShell / cmd / WSL / `$SHELL`), Telnet, serial |
| **Transfers** | SFTP file panel, batch download, ZMODEM in the terminal, WebDAV sync |
| **Terminals** | Full VT/ANSI, mouse tracking, DEC line drawing, colour emoji, split panes |
| **Monitoring** | Local + remote CPU / memory / swap / disk / network, remote process list |
| **Automation** | A `cli` for scripts and CI, and an MCP server for AI clients |
| **Interface** | GPUI-rendered, English / Simplified Chinese, collapsible docked panels |

## The interface

The window is a navigation rail and one page at a time — three pages, each owning its own
state and reporting only what crosses its border to the shell:

- **Terminal** — the working surface. A tab strip, nestable horizontal split panes, a
  floating command line with the quick-command and command-history popovers, the resource
  sidebar, and the file panel docked to the bottom or the right.
- **Sessions** — the saved connections and the built-in local shells, with groups,
  import/export and the session editor.
- **Settings** — everything in the table further down.

Two monitors are separate windows rather than panels, because they are tables you keep
open beside the terminal while you work in it: the **process monitor** and the
**system information** window. The transfer list, the tunnel list and the file panel are
panels, so they stay attached to the window whose sessions they belong to.

## Features

### Sessions and connection

- **Four session types** — SSH, local shell, Telnet and serial, in the same tabbed UI.
- **Local shells out of the box** — PowerShell, `cmd.exe` and every configured WSL
  distribution on Windows; `$SHELL` elsewhere. Windows shells start in UTF-8.
- **Ordered SSH bastions** — add saved SSH sessions on the session editor’s SSH bastions page, move any hop earlier/later, or remove it. The displayed order is outermost first; each hop uses its own credentials. Existing `jump_session_id` configurations still work, including nested legacy routes.
- **SSH authentication** — password, private key, passphrase-protected key, and
  keyboard-interactive for 2FA / OTP prompts.
- **PuTTY `.ppk` keys** — PPK v2/v3 is decrypted and verified in memory; no `puttygen`
  round-trip.
- **Outbound proxies** — SOCKS5 (`socks5://`, `socks5h://`) and HTTP/HTTPS CONNECT, set
  per session or picked up from `ALL_PROXY`. Telnet uses the same plumbing.
- **Serial** — configurable baud rate, data/stop bits, parity and flow control.
- **Telnet** with an RFC 854/855 option state machine (SGA + NAWS window resizing).
- **Triggers** — expect/send rules for interactive logins, each with its own response.
- **Session groups** — create, rename and delete folders, plus per-session notes.
- **Host key verification** — trust on first use with a SHA-256 fingerprint prompt, and a
  hard warning if a key later changes.

> Session passwords and keys can also be entered without the GUI, and the config supports
> per-session encodings. Ordered jump routes can be edited in the GUI. Imported
> `jump_session_ids` are ordered from the outermost bastion toward the target;
> when present, they override legacy `jump_session_id` links. Invalid, repeated,
> missing, non-SSH or more-than-16-hop routes fail before network activity.

### Terminal

- **Full VT/ANSI emulation** — `htop`, `btop`, `vim`, `tmux` and friends render correctly
  full-screen, over a 100,000-line scrollback.
- **Mouse tracking** — SGR and X10 mouse reports are forwarded to TUI applications that
  ask for them, so `htop` and `mc` respond to clicks.
- **DEC line drawing** — the VT100 special-graphics charset, so `dialog` and `mc` frames
  draw properly even in UTF-8 mode.
- **Colour emoji** — skin tones, flags and ZWJ sequences render in colour, from Twemoji
  images embedded in the binary.
- **Character encodings** — the terminal decodes per-session charsets (UTF-8 by default,
  GBK and others) with a streaming decoder, so a multi-byte character split across packets
  still decodes.
- **Output highlighting** — colour log levels (with a DevOps preset) and your own rules,
  without disturbing output that already carries its own colours.
- **Split panes** — nestable horizontal splits, from the tab's context menu; drag the
  splitter to resize. Tabs reorder by dragging within the strip or from the same menu.
- **Find in the scrollback**, paging keys that scroll the scrollback on the normal screen
  and reach the program on the alternate screen as they should.
- **Paste protection** — multi-line pastes can require confirmation, and the extra paste
  shortcuts (`Ctrl+Alt+V`, `Shift+Insert`) can be turned off.
- **Font and cursor** — any installed monospace family plus a bundled one, size, line
  spacing, bold, and block / bar / underline cursors with a custom colour.

### Files

- **SFTP panel** that follows the terminal's `cd`, with a lazy-loading directory tree.
- **Upload and download** single files or whole directory trees, from the toolbar or the
  file panel's context menu.
- **Batch download** — the selection is tarred on the remote side, pulled down as one
  file, and the remote temp file is cleaned up.
- **Built-in viewer / editor** — a plain text editor for small files, read-only when the
  file is; opening a file in your own editor re-uploads it when you save.
- **File operations** — rename, delete, create file or directory, and `chmod` that keeps
  the setuid / setgid / sticky bits.
- **Copy between sessions** — move remote files from one SFTP session into another.
- **Conflict handling** — replace or keep both, per download.
- **ZMODEM** in the terminal: `sz` on the remote downloads to your Downloads folder; `rz`
  opens a local file picker and uploads over the existing PTY.
- **WebDAV sync** — upload and download the connection list by hand, with an option to
  accept self-signed certificates.

### Monitoring

- **Local system panel** — CPU, memory, swap, network throughput and per-filesystem usage,
  with sparklines.
- **Remote monitoring over SSH** — the same metrics read from `/proc` and `df` on the
  server, refreshed every two seconds.
- **Remote process list** — CPU-sorted, with copyable PIDs and the ability to terminate a
  process you own (signalling another user's process asks first).
- **System information window** — OS, kernel, architecture, hostname, CPU, memory,
  filesystems and GPU.

### Automation

- **CLI** — one-shot SSH commands, file listing / reading / transfer, and session
  inspection, with human-readable output or `--json`.
- **MCP server** — exposes the same saved sessions to an MCP-capable AI client over local
  stdio: session lookup, remote commands, directory listing, bounded text reads, uploads
  and downloads. Each capability is behind its own permission switch, and credentials are
  never returned to the client.

## Install

Every `v*` tag builds **Windows**, **macOS** (Apple Silicon and Intel) and **Linux**
(x86_64 and aarch64) packages in GitHub Actions and publishes them on the
[Releases](https://github.com/ixbaicn/XenTerm/releases) page.

### Windows

- **Installer** — run `xenterm-<version>-windows-x86_64.msi` and choose an install
  location.
- **Portable** — unzip `xenterm-<version>-windows-x86_64.zip` and run `xenterm.exe`.

### macOS

The download is a `.zip` containing `xenterm.app`:

```bash
# aarch64 = Apple Silicon, x86_64 = Intel
unzip xenterm-*-macos-*.zip

# Optional: move it into Applications (running it in place also works)
mv xenterm.app /Applications/

# Clear the quarantine flag, or macOS reports "xenterm is damaged and can't be opened"
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/xenterm.app

open /Applications/xenterm.app
```

If you did not move it, point both paths above at wherever the `.app` actually is.
Requires macOS 11 Big Sur or later.

### Linux

| Package | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Debian / Ubuntu | `sudo apt install ./xenterm-*-linux-amd64.deb` |
| Fedora / others | `tar -xzf xenterm-*-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` |
| Flatpak | `flatpak install --user xenterm-*.flatpak` |
| AppImage | `chmod +x xenterm-*.AppImage && ./xenterm-*.AppImage` |
| Arch (AUR) | `yay -S xenterm-bin` |

The tarball runs directly:

```bash
tar -xzf xenterm-*-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd xenterm-*-linux-x86_64
./xenterm

# Optional: system-wide install of the binary, icon and launcher (needs sudo)
chmod +x install-linux.sh && ./install-linux.sh
```

The installer puts the binary in `/usr/local/bin/xenterm`, the launcher in
`/usr/local/share/applications/xenterm.desktop` and the icon in
`/usr/local/share/icons/hicolor/512x512/apps/xenterm.png`.

> Requires glibc ≥ 2.35 (Ubuntu 22.04+ / Debian 12+). If you need an older baseline, the
> `-glibc228` tarballs are built against glibc 2.28 (Debian 10).

> On Wayland you may need to log out and back in once after installing the icon, so the
> shell picks it up.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ixbaicn/XenTerm
cd xenterm
cargo run --release
```

On first launch XenTerm creates an empty session store. Add your first server with **New
Session**, or import one — `~/.ssh/config`, a FinalShell connection export, a previous
XenTerm export, or a pasted `host|port|user|password|name` list are all supported.

### Headless CLI / authenticated remote MCP

Build without the GPUI desktop libraries:

```sh
cargo build --locked --release --no-default-features --features headless
```

The default build still includes the complete GUI, CLI and stdio MCP. The opt-in
HTTP service uses external OAuth access tokens, a deliberately selected private
profile, and an existing HTTPS reverse proxy. See [remote MCP deployment and
verification](docs/REMOTE_MCP.md), including OpenResty routing for multiple MCP
services on one domain. No public listener, account or deployment is created by
the build.

### Building on Linux

`cargo run` needs the system development packages the GUI stack links against:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends \
  build-essential pkg-config cmake \
  libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype6-dev \
  libxcb1-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev \
  libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libwayland-dev \
  libgl1-mesa-dev libegl1-mesa-dev libgtk-3-dev \
  libudev-dev
```

## Keyboard shortcuts

`⌘` denotes Command on macOS, where other platforms use `Ctrl`. The clipboard set is
deliberate: plain `Ctrl+C` stays `SIGINT`, which is the one shortcut a terminal must not
take away.

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` | Next / previous tab |
| `Ctrl+K` | Quick-connect palette |
| `Enter` on a dead session | Reconnect it |
| `Ctrl+Shift+C` | Copy selection |
| `Ctrl+V` / `Ctrl+Shift+V` | Paste |
| `Ctrl+Alt+V` / `Shift+Insert` | Extra paste shortcuts (switchable) |
| `Ctrl+F` | Find in the terminal; `Esc` closes the bar |
| `Ctrl+=` / `Ctrl+-` / `Ctrl+0` | Zoom this session's font |
| `PageUp` / `Home` / `PageDown` / `End` | Scroll the scrollback (normal screen only) |

A second window is opened from the operating system's own entry point — the Windows
taskbar jump list, the macOS dock menu, or the desktop action on Linux.

## Settings

**Interface** — theme (system / dark / light), panel font size, and the interface
language.
**Terminal**

| Page | Settings |
| --- | --- |
| Font | Family (any installed monospace family, plus the bundled one), size, bold, line spacing |
| Cursor | Shape (block / bar / underline) and colour |
| Input | Confirm multi-line paste; the extra paste shortcuts; panel strip height |
| Highlight | Enable output highlighting, the preset (log levels / DevOps), and your own rules with add / enable / delete |

**Connections** — import `~/.ssh/config`, export every saved connection to a file.
**Pasting** (under Connections) — paste a `host|port|user|password|name` list and import it
in bulk.
**Files** — a default download directory and whether to always ask where to save.
**Sync** — WebDAV: enable, address, username, password, remote path, accept invalid
certificates, and the upload / download buttons.
**Automation** — the four switches, split by what they actually govern: **Unattended
access** (use saved credentials, allow arbitrary SSH commands, allow file transfers) and
the MCP server's own **MCP server** switch.

## CLI and MCP

The CLI and the MCP server share the sessions saved in the GUI and the same SSH / SFTP
implementation, so there is only one server list to maintain. The CLI suits scripts, CI
and explicit commands; MCP lets an AI client do inspection, log analysis and file
transfers from a natural-language request.

> Connect to the target session in the GUI at least once first, so the host key is
> confirmed. Passwords and private keys never appear in CLI or MCP output — and do not put
> plaintext passwords into prompts or MCP configuration files.

### CLI

```bash
xenterm cli help
```

```bash
# List saved sessions; the first column is the session-id used below
xenterm cli sessions
xenterm cli sessions --json

# Non-secret metadata for one session
xenterm cli session <session-id>

# Run a non-interactive command; the remote command follows --
xenterm cli exec <session-id> -- free -h
xenterm cli exec <session-id> --timeout 60 --json -- journalctl -n 100 --no-pager

# Browse, read and transfer remote files
xenterm cli files <session-id> /var/log
xenterm cli read <session-id> /var/log/example.log
xenterm cli upload <session-id> ./local.txt /tmp
xenterm cli download <session-id> /tmp/result.txt ./downloads
```

Downloads require an existing local destination directory and will not overwrite a file of
the same name.

### MCP

Open **Settings → Automation → MCP server** in XenTerm and turn on what you need: enable
MCP, then allow saved credentials, arbitrary SSH commands and file transfers as your use
case requires. The three unattended-access switches default to on while MCP is in preview.

Then register the stdio server in your MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xenterm": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/xenterm",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

On Windows, `command` can be `C:\\path\\to\\xenterm.exe`. Restart or refresh the client and
you should see an `xenterm` server exposing seven tools — `list_sessions`, `get_session`,
`run_command`, `list_remote_files`, `read_remote_text_file`, `upload_file`,
`download_file`. MCP configuration files live in different places per client, so check that
client's documentation.

#### Debugging the stdio connection

An AI client generates these requests for you. When debugging by hand, send each one as a
single line of JSON, in this order:

```jsonl
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-11-25","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"example-client","version":"1.0.0"}}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized","params":{}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}
```

List sessions, then run a read-only OOM diagnosis and browse the heap-dump directory:

```jsonl
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"list_sessions","arguments":{}}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":4,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"session_id":"<session-id>","command":"free -h; dmesg 2>/dev/null | grep -iE 'oom|killed process' | tail -50 || true; ps -ef | grep '[j]ava'","timeout_seconds":30,"max_output_bytes":1048576}}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":5,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"list_remote_files","arguments":{"session_id":"<session-id>","path":"/home/jeff/test/heapdumps"}}}
```

`read_remote_text_file` accepts only bounded UTF-8 text; for binaries such as HPROF use
`download_file`, which requires an existing local directory and will not overwrite a file
of the same name.

A prompt you could give an MCP-capable client:

> Use the `xenterm` MCP to investigate an OOM on my `192.168.100.41` server. Heap dumps are
> in `/home/jeff/test/heapdumps`. Check system memory, kernel OOM records, Java processes,
> application logs and the HPROF files, then identify the root cause. Read-only diagnostics
> first — do not restart services or delete files.

The server finds the session with `list_sessions` and then acts within the permissions you
granted. If several sessions share a host, name the GUI session in the prompt.

## Configuration and data

XenTerm is **portable-first**: if a writable `config/` folder sits next to the executable
(a USB stick, an extracted tarball), everything lives there. Otherwise it falls back to the
per-user OS config directory:

| Platform | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\xenterm\XenTerm\config` |
| Linux | `~/.config/xenterm` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/dev.xenterm.XenTerm` |

Upgrading from the pre-rename build (`meatshell`) migrates `sessions.json`, `secret.key`
and `known_hosts` automatically — copies are left in place, and existing files are never
overwritten. Diagnostics go to a separate `log/` directory beside the config, with
`error.log` capped at 50 MiB.

## Security notes

- **Passwords at rest** go to the OS keychain (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain,
  Linux Secret Service) whenever it is available. When it is not, they are encrypted with
  **ChaCha20-Poly1305** under a per-install key in `secret.key`, so `sessions.json` never
  contains a plaintext password.
- **Exported connection lists are portable, not secret.** The export format uses a fixed
  key compiled into the binary so a file opens on any machine — that is obfuscation, the
  same level as a FinalShell export, not encryption to rely on.
- **Host keys** are remembered by XenTerm itself in its own `known_hosts` file (a
  `host:port <key-type> <base64>` format), which is not OpenSSH's file.
- **Secrets are zeroed on drop**, so plaintext credentials do not linger in freed memory.

## Development

- **The interface is GPUI only.** There is no feature flag to build against and no second
  frontend to keep in step. A bare `xenterm` launch and the migration-era `xenterm gpui`
  argument both open the same shell.
- **A page is a view with its own state**, built on first entry and kept after that, so a
  half-typed filter or a scroll position survives switching away. The shell renders exactly
  one page per frame; anything that cannot be done inside the page is queued and drained by
  the shell at the top of the next frame, which is also why a click is never carried out
  inside the render that received it.
- **The interface uses icon-font glyphs and words, never emoji** — enforced by a test that
  scans `src/ui`, because a check that ran once is a fact about that day rather than a
  property of the code.
- **Translations are pairs of literals**, not a catalogue: `crate::i18n::t("中文", "English")`
  picks by the current language flag, and both languages ship in the binary.
- **`cargo check` is the fastest feedback loop** while editing the UI.
- Run the test suite with `cargo test`; the integration tests live under `tests/app/`.
  Only the three suites wired in through `#[path]` are actually compiled today, so add a
  new module to `mod.rs` rather than only creating the file.

## Release

Do not bump `Cargo.toml` by hand and then tag it. Use the release script, so the tag points
at a commit that already carries the matching version:

```powershell
.\scripts\release.ps1 v0.7.4 -Push
```

It requires no uncommitted tracked-file changes, updates `Cargo.toml` and the `xenterm`
entry in `Cargo.lock`, runs `cargo check --locked`, verifies `xenterm --version`, commits
`Release v0.7.4` and creates an annotated tag, then pushes the branch and tag. See
[docs/release.md](docs/release.md).

> **Before the first release from this tree**, the workflow's Linux runners may need extra
> apt packages for GPUI's platform libraries, and GPUI's Windows crate wants `fxc.exe` from
> the Windows SDK for release builds (debug builds skip that step). Both are recorded in
> `Cargo.toml` rather than assumed away.
