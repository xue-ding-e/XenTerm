//! The session protocol: the vocabulary a running session and whatever drives it
//! exchange, plus the routes a tab's events travel over.
//!
//! This is not an SSH implementation detail, which is why it is not in
//! `crate::ssh`. `crate::terminal` (local, telnet, serial, zmodem), `crate::sftp`,
//! `crate::tunnel`, `crate::core`, `crate::app`, `crate::automation` and
//! `crate::ui` all speak it, and every one of them used to depend on the SSH
//! module merely to name a message type. Moving the vocabulary here leaves
//! `crate::ssh` as one consumer among many.
//!
//! The file is deliberately a leaf: its only crate-internal dependencies are
//! `crate::config`, `crate::core`, `crate::sftp` and `crate::terminal`, none of
//! which reach back into it, so no cycle can pass through this module. That
//! property is what lets the terminal layer describe a session without adopting
//! the SSH layer, and it is asserted in `crate::arch_guards`.
//!
//! The types arrived from `src/ssh/struct/{command,event,responders,remote_fs,system}.rs`
//! and from `crate::app::core` (the tab route), which is where the first session
//! implementation kept them. Nothing here behaves differently for the move.
