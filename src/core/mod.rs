// Framework-agnostic application core.
//
// Nothing in here may name a UI toolkit or any of its types. The UI shell
// (`crate::ui`) projects this state into whatever model that toolkit wants, and
// the out-of-process plugin host reads and commands the same surface.
//
// This module exists because state ownership had split. The per-tab terminal and
// transfer rows the interface observed were not views onto Rust state — they *were*
// the authoritative stores for per-tab status text, scroll position, SFTP
// listings, and transfer bookkeeping. Code read them back out of the toolkit's own
// model objects, downcast them, and mutated rows in place. That made the UI
// framework the source of truth for application state, which is why swapping
// frameworks meant rewriting logic and not just widgets.
//
// Each type reified here moves one of those stores back into Rust. The toolkit
// model then becomes a derived projection that can be rebuilt from scratch at
// any time, and the same projection step is what a plugin capability or a view
// consumes.
