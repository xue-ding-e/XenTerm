//! The resource panel: what the host on the other end of the active session is doing,
//! and what this machine is doing, in one column.
//!
//! ## Where the numbers come from
//!
//! Two stores, neither of them this view's. A session's samples are written into
//! [`crate::resource::TabStatus`] by the event path (`super::view::apply_event`), and
//! this machine's are written by the sampler task this view starts. Both are
//! `Arc<Mutex<_>>` because their producers run off the UI thread — the same arrangement
//! the shell uses, which is the point: the two panels are two projections of one set of
//! stores rather than two measurements of the same machine. Everything that
//! decides *what* a number means (a used fraction, an auto-scaled history, which NIC is
//! on top, how a size is spelled) lives in `crate::resource`, so the two panels cannot
//! disagree about it.
//!
//! ## Why it polls
//!
//! Nothing pushes to this view. A remote sample arrives on the tab's own channel and is
//! handled by the terminal view that owns it, and the local sampler is a task with no
//! route into a sibling view. So the panel reads the stores once a second, and repaints
//! only when what it would draw has actually changed — a panel that repainted every
//! second would keep the GPU awake to show the same numbers.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately absent
//!
//! Docking to any of the four edges, and dragging the panel by its header, are absent:
//! this shell lays out a fixed right-hand column, so a panel that could be dragged to
//! the bottom edge would be one that cannot actually go there. The collapse button is
//! kept, because collapsing is a decision about this column and does not need a dock.
//!
//! The System-information and Processes buttons appear only for a live remote session,
//! which is the only kind with a process sample and a detailed probe behind it
//! (`super::system_info_window`, `super::process_window`): a button that opened an empty
//! window would be worse than no button — the rule the SFTP panel follows for its
//! directory tree.
