//! The SFTP panel: the remote directory, its columns, and what you can do to a row.
//!
//! The second view of the migration, and the first one that reads state a *session*
//! fills rather than state the user typed. `crate::core::SftpListing` already holds the
//! path, the files, the current sort and the selection — it lives in the core rather
//! than in the view — so this module owns no state of its own beyond what the panel
//! itself needs to look alive (a spinner and a status line, both of which come from
//! events).
//!
//! What it deliberately does not do yet: the left-hand directory tree, drag-and-drop
//! upload, and the file viewer/editor. Each is a view of its own and the panel is
//! useful without them; the buttons that would open them are absent rather than
//! present-and-dead, because a button that does nothing is worse than no button.
//!
//! **The original's callbacks, checked one by one against this panel.** Not a guess and not a
//! memory: the original declared the list, and each entry is either here or named below as
//! missing. The check was worth doing once, because it is the only way to answer "is anything
//! absent" without reading two implementations side by side and hoping.
//!
//! Present: navigate, refresh, toggle-select, sort (the original also has `clear-sort`, which
//! its three-way cycle folds in), download, download-selected, upload, delete,
//! delete-selected, new-folder, new-file, rename-request, chmod-request, edit-external (as
//! `OpenTemp`), dock collapse, and the tunnel actions, which live in their own panel here.
//!
//! Missing, and each one is a real difference rather than a naming one:
//!
//! - **the directory tree** (`tree-expand`, `persist-tree-width`), the left-hand folder pane.
//!   The core even has `toggle_tree_node`; nothing in this frontend calls it.
//! - **dock dragging** (`dock-drag-move`, `dock-drag-end`) — moving this panel between the
//!   bottom edge and the right one. Not a grip's worth of work: where the panel lives is
//!   decided by the shell's pane layout, so it is a layout change with a setting behind it,
//!   not a drag handler.
//!
//! **Closed since this list was written**, which is the point of keeping it: the built-in
//! viewer and editor (`edit` / `view`, now a dialog of its own in `file_viewer.rs`), the
//! single-row `copy-to-target` (the row menu's 复制到 entries), `open-external` (用默认程序打开,
//! the same session command as `edit-external` with the watching turned off), and `copy-path`
//! (复制路径, offered for directories too — a folder's path is the one row action a folder
//! wants), and `copy-selected-to-target` (the batch toolbar's 复制到其他会话 dropdown, which
//! carries every ticked row and appears only when something is ticked).
//!
//! Most of the closed ones are row-menu entries, which is why the tests here cannot cover them:
//! a `PopupMenuItem` is rendered by the toolkit's own popup layer, so `debug_bounds` cannot find
//! it and a click cannot reach it. The same is true of everything still on the list. That
//! limitation is worth knowing before writing a test that fails for it — and it is why the
//! viewer, once it had behaviour of its own, got its own module and its own tests instead of
//! another entry here.
