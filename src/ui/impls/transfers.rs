//! The transfer manager: every download and upload this window has seen.
//!
//! ## Why it exists
//!
//! The SFTP panel can start a download and an upload, and until this view both were
//! invisible: the progress events arrived, were written into the shared store, and
//! nothing drew it. A transfer with no progress is indistinguishable from a transfer
//! that never started.
//!
//! ## Where the rows come from
//!
//! `crate::core::TransferStore` — the shared transfer store, with the same
//! `Transfer::detail()` and `Transfer::percent()` projections. The store owns row
//! identity, ordering and the in-progress count; this view only reads it,
//! and reports what the user asked for (cancel one, clear the list, open the folder)
//! back to the shell, which holds the session handles and the config.
//!
//! ## Where it is drawn
//!
//! As a popover anchored to the tab strip's transfer button — the same bubble the
//! command bar's quick commands and history use, and the same shape the original gives
//! it. The list scrolls inside a fixed width instead of following the window, because a
//! bubble the width of the window would be a panel with a tail.
