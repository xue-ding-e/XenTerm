//! The folding chevron, shared by every list that folds a group away.
//!
//! One icon, rotated — not two icons swapped. The swap answered "which way is it
//! pointing" but skipped how it got there, and a heading whose arrow changes
//! species in one frame reads as a flicker rather than a fold. The rotation is
//! driven per toggle: a counter is bumped each time a group turns, and the
//! counter both salts the animation's element id (so the next toggle starts a
//! new swing instead of continuing the old clock) and tells the icon to animate
//! at all. A group never toggled draws its angle statically, so first paint has
//! no animation and a re-render for unrelated reasons — a search keystroke, a
//! selection — does not re-sweep arrows that did not move.
