//! The destination session pumps deliver to, and the render-gate protocol.
//!
//! A pump thread calls [`EventSink::deliver`] and [`EventSink::request_render`] and
//! never learns which implementation is on the other end.
//!
//! What the sink shares with the pumps is more than a trait. The render gate
//! (`crate::terminal::TabRenderGate`) is framework-agnostic and this uses the same
//! one with the same protocol: a pump that has filled the parser asks for a render,
//! gets a ticket, and blocks on it until the frame it asked for exists. That pacing
//! is what stops a firehose from becoming one UI task per chunk, and a second
//! implementation would be a second place for it to be wrong. Only the marshalling
//! differs: the pump leaves its events on a channel that a task on the view drains.
//!
//! Why a channel rather than `WeakEntity::update`: `deliver` runs on a plain
//! `std::thread` that owns no `App` and cannot obtain one, and GPUI's
//! `ForegroundExecutor` is deliberately not `Send`. A channel is what the local
//! session's pump in [`super::view`] already uses for the same reason, and putting
//! both kinds of work through one queue also preserves their order — a render
//! request must not overtake the events it is meant to show.
