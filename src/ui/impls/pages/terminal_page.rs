//! The terminal workspace page: the tab strip, the panes, the command bar and
//! the file dock — the part of the window the user actually works in.
//!
//! Everything here used to live on the shell, which is why the shell was
//! nearly four thousand lines: a tab is not a window-level thing, it is a
//! thing this page owns. The page keeps the shell's old doctrine where the
//! doctrine was earned — the pane width is *derived*, never measured, and a
//! click is carried out at the top of the next frame, never inside the render
//! that received it — and reports to the shell only what crosses the page's
//! border: a connect, a tab change the other pages have to follow, a status
//! line note.
