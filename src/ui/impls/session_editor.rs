//! The session editor: create a session, or change one.
//!
//! ## What this is responsible for
//!
//! The form itself, and nothing else. What a filled-in form *means* is
//! [`crate::core::SessionDraft::to_session`]'s job — the defaults per kind, the rule
//! that a blank password keeps the saved one, the dropping of half-filled rows. Editing
//! that logic here would give the two frontends two answers to "what did the user
//! write", which is exactly the split `SessionDraft` was extracted to prevent.
//!
//! ## Why the fields are the library's, and the state is ours
//!
//! `SettingField`'s closures take `&mut App`, so they cannot borrow the view. The draft
//! therefore lives in an `Rc<RefCell<SessionDraft>>` that every field captures, and the
//! view re-reads it when it saves. That is the same shape `SettingsView` uses for the
//! config store, and it is why a field can be declared with two closures instead of a
//! message enum per control.
