//! The quick-command dock: the commands a session is expected to need, one click away.
//!
//! ## Where the rows come from
//!
//! `crate::core::quick` — the grouping rule (the implicit "default" group first, then
//! named groups alphabetically, entries in their saved order) that this dock projects.
//! What stays here is the one thing that is a view's own: which groups the user has
//! folded.
//!
//! ## What is the original's, and what is not
//!
//! The panel's shape: a title strip with a close button, a scrolling list of foldable
//! groups whose entries show the name over the command it runs, and a manage button
//! along the bottom. The dock can be moved between the right edge and the bottom, which
//! is the shell's business — it owns the layout — so the panel only knows which edge it
//! is on, for its close button's icon.
//!
//! Clicking an entry either sends it or drops it into the command bar: that is the
//! `send_enter` flag, and it is the whole reason a quick command has one.
