//! The UI shell: the tab strip, the panes, the pages and the windows —
//! everything the user sees, drawn with GPUI.
//!
//! This began as the target of a migration away from a second frontend; that
//! frontend is gone now, so a bare `xenterm` launch lands here. The explicit
//! `gpui` argument from the migration window is still accepted and means the
//! same thing as no argument at all.
//!
//! The module keeps the shell's old doctrine where the doctrine was earned —
//! the pane width is *derived*, never measured, and a click is carried out at
//! the top of the next frame, never inside the render that received it — and
//! reports to the shell only what crosses the page's border.
